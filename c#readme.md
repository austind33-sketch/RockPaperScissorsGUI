# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to stay updated with new technologies, tackle complex projects, and i hobe to be able to contribute to soem amazing open-source communities. Improving problem-solving skills and adopting best practices are some of my key focuses. Networking and seeking mentorship will also help me grow professionally.
### Description of the Software

This software is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using C#. Players can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer. The game displays results and tracks statistics like rounds played, wins, losses, and draws.

### Purpose of Writing the Software

The purpose of this software is to **demonstrate C# capabilities** in creating an interactive GUI application. It highlights event handling, random number generation, custom drawing, and basic game logic.

Inheritance: Created an abstract base class GameBase and extended it in MainForm.

File I/O: Added methods to save and load game statistics to and from a file (stats.txt).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work
Some future functionality that I plan on adding when I have time:

- Add multiplayer functionality
- Create different difficulty levels
- Allow for more user personalisation, such as name inputs and avatar choices
